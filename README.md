Good Evening,
Tonight we are going to talk about employee attrition. I am Sakava Kiv, a Data Scientist who is an expert in helping companies prosper. As you know, every industry wants to keep their talent especially in rapidly evolving markets, with a wide range of factors that can impact a company's success. I specialize in leveraging data science to help companies or businesses make more informed decisions, drive innovation, and stay ahead of their respective industries. Tonight, I'd like to share with you some insights I have gathered from a year's worth of data analysis on attrition rates for Frito lay and how we can use data science to keep employees wanting to work here for the long term.
